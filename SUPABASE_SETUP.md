# Supabase Backend Setup for HSC Hand Notes

Follow these steps to set up your Supabase project.

## 1. Create a Supabase Project

If you haven't already, go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/), create an account, and start a new project.

## 2. Database Table Generation

Go to the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase project dashboard and run the following SQL command to create the `notes` table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.notes (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  subject TEXT NOT NULL,
  chapter_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  topic_title TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_html TEXT,
  pdf_url TEXT,
  is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);

COMMENT ON TABLE public.notes IS 'Stores all the handwritten study notes.';
```

This schema includes:
- `id`: A unique identifier for each note.
- `subject`, `chapter_name`, `topic_title`: For organizing the content.
- `content_html`: To store notes written in HTML format.
- `pdf_url`: A link to a PDF file stored in Supabase Storage.
- `is_published`: A flag to control visibility (defaults to `TRUE`).
- `created_at`: A timestamp for when the note was created.

## 3. Row Level Security (RLS) Policy

Security is crucial. We need to enable Row Level Security (RLS) on the `notes` table and then create a policy that allows public read access.

### a. Enable RLS

In the **SQL Editor**, run this command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### b. Create Read-Only Policy for Public Access

Now, create the policy that allows anyone to read (`SELECT`) notes that are marked as `is_published`. This policy **prevents** any anonymous user from inserting, updating, or deleting data.

In the **SQL Editor**, run this command:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access to published notes"
ON public.notes
FOR SELECT
TO anon, authenticated
USING (is_published = TRUE);
```

## 4. Get Project Credentials

You'll need your Supabase Project URL and the `anon` (public) key to connect your Next.js application.

1.  Go to your project's **Settings**.
2.  Click on the **API** tab.
3.  Under **Project API Keys**, you will find your `anon` key (labeled as `public`).
4.  You will also find your Project **URL** there.

These will be used as environment variables in your Next.js application.
